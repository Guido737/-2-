_section: Contract Interaction @<contracts>

A **Contract** object is an abstraction of a contract (EVM bytecode)
deployed on the Ethereum network. It allows for a simple way to
serialize calls and transactions to an on-chain contract and
deserialize their results and emitted logs.

A **ContractFactory** is an abstraction of a contract's //bytecode//
and facilitates deploying a contract.
