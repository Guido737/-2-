_section: Getting Started @<getting-started>


_subsection: Installing @<installing>

Ethers' various Classes and Functions are available to import
manually from sub-packages under the [@ethersproject](link-ethers-npm)
organization but for most projects, the umbrella package is the
easiest way to get started.

_code: @lang<shell>

/home/ricmoo> npm install --save ethers


_subsection: Importing @<importing>

_heading: Node.js

_code: node.js require @lang<script>

const { ethers } = require("ethers");

_code: ES6 or TypeScript @lang<script>

import { ethers } from "ethers";


_heading: Web Browser

It is generally better practice (for security reasons) to copy the
[ethers library](link-ethers-js) to your own webserver and serve it
yourself.

For quick demos or prototyping though, you can load it in your
Web Applications from our CDN.


_code: ES6 in the Browser @lang<html>

<script type="module">
    import { ethers } from "https://cdn.ethers.io/lib/ethers-5.0.esm.min.js";
    // Your code here...
</script>


_code: ES3 (UMD) in the Browser @lang<html>

<script src="https://cdn.ethers.io/lib/ethers-5.0.umd.min.js"
        type="application/javascript"></script>


_subsection: Common Terminology @<getting-started--glossary>

This section needs work...

_table: Common Terms

$Provider:  A Provider (in ethers) is a class which provides an abstraction
            for a connection to the Ethereum Network. It provides read-only
            access to the Blockchain and its status.
$Signer:    A Signer is a class which (usually) in some way directly or
            indirectly has access to a private key, which can sign messages
            and transactions to authorize the network to charge your account
            ether to perform operations.
$Contract:  A Contract is an abstraction which represents a connection to a
            specific contract on the Ethereum Network, so that applications 
            can use it like a normal JavaScript object.


| **Provider**     | $Provider      |
| **Signer**       | $Signer        |
| **Contract**     | $Contract      |


_subsection: Connecting to Ethereum: Metamask @<getting-started--connecting>

The quickest and easiest way to experiment and begin developing on
Ethereum is to use [[link-metamask]], which is a browser extension
that provides:

- A connection to the Ethereum network (a [[Provider]])
- Holds your private key and can sign things (a [[Signer]])

_code: Connecting to Metamask @lang<script>

// A Web3Provider wraps a standard Web3 provider, which is
// what Metamask injects as window.ethereum into each page
const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum)

// The Metamask plugin also allows signing transactions to
// send ether and pay to change state within the blockchain.
// For this, you need the account signer...
const signer = provider.getSigner()

_subsection: Connecting to Ethereum: RPC @<getting-started--connecting-rpc>

The [JSON-RPC API](link-jsonrpc) is another popular method for interacting
with Ethereum and is available in all major Ethereum node implementations
(e.g. [[link-geth]] and [[link-parity]]) as well as many
third-party web services (e.g. [[link-infura]]). It typically provides:

- A connection to the Ethereum network (a [[Provider]])
- Holds your private key and can sign thing (a [[Signer]])

_code: Connecting to an RPC client @lang<script>

// If you don't specify a //url//, Ethers connects to the default 
// (i.e. ``http:/\/localhost:8545``)
const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider();

// The provider also allows signing transactions to
// send ether and pay to change state within the blockchain.
// For this, we need the account signer...
const signer = provider.getSigner()

_heading: Querying the Blockchain @<getting-started--querying>

Once you have a [[Provider]], you have a read-only connection to the
blockchain, which you can use to query the current state, fetch historic
logs, look up deployed code and so on.

_code: Basic Queries @lang<javascript>

// Look up the current block number
provider.getBlockNumber()
//!

// Get the balance of an account (by address or ENS name, if supported by network)
balance = await provider.getBalance("ethers.eth")
//! async balance

// Often you need to format the output to something more user-friendly,
// such as in ether (instead of wei)
ethers.utils.formatEther(balance)
//!

// If a user enters a string in an input field, you may need
// to convert it from ether (as a string) to wei (as a BigNumber)
ethers.utils.parseEther("1.0")
//!


_heading: Writing to the Blockchain @<getting-started--sending>

_code: Sending Ether @lang<script>

// Send 1 ether to an ens name.
const tx = signer.sendTransaction({
    to: "ricmoo.firefly.eth",
    value: ethers.utils.parseEther("1.0")
});


_subsection: Contracts @<getting-started--contracts>

A Contract is an abstraction of program code which lives on the
Ethereum blockchain.

The [[Contract]] object makes it easier to use an on-chain
Contract as a normal JavaScript object, with the methods
mapped to encoding and decoding data for you.

If you are familiar with Databases, this is similar to an //Object Relational Mapper// (ORM).

In order to communicate with the Contract on-chain, this class
needs to know what methods are available and how to encode and
decode the data, which is what the //Application Binary Interface// (ABI)
provides.

This class is a //meta-class//, which means its methods are constructed
at runtime, and when you pass in the ABI to the constructor it uses it
to determine which methods to add.

While an on-chain Contract may have many methods available, you can safely ignore
any methods you don't need or use, providing a smaller subset of the ABI to
the contract.

An ABI often comes from the Solidity or Vyper compiler, but you can use the
Human-Readable ABI in code, which the following examples use.

_code: Connecting to the DAI Contract @lang<javascript>

// You can also use an ENS name for the contract address
const daiAddress = "dai.tokens.ethers.eth";

// The ERC-20 Contract ABI, which is a common contract interface
// for tokens (this is the Human-Readable ABI format)
const daiAbi = [
  // Some details about the token
  "function name() view returns (string)",
  "function symbol() view returns (string)",

  // Get the account balance
  "function balanceOf(address) view returns (uint)",

  // Send some of your tokens to someone else
  "function transfer(address to, uint amount)",

  // An event triggered whenever anyone transfers to someone else
  "event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint amount)"
];

// The Contract object
const daiContract = new ethers.Contract(daiAddress, daiAbi, provider);

const daiAbi = [
  // Some simple details about the token

];
const daiContract = new ethers.Contract("dai.tokens.ethers.eth", daiAbi, provider);
// </hide>

// Get the ERC-20 token name
daiContract.name()

// Get the ERC-20 token symbol (for tickers and UIs)
daiContract.symbol()

// Get the balance of an address
balance = await daiContract.balanceOf("ricmoo.firefly.eth")
//! async balance

// Format the DAI for displaying to the user

_heading: State Changing Methods @<getting-started--writing>

_code: Sending DAI @lang<script>

// The DAI Contract is currently connected to the Provider,

const daiWithSigner = contract.connect(signer);

// Each DAI has 18 decimal places
const dai = ethers.utils.parseUnits("1.0", 18);

// Send 1 DAI to "ricmoo.firefly.eth"
tx = daiWithSigner.transfer("ricmoo.firefly.eth", dai);

// </hide>

// Receive an event when ANY transfer occurs
daiContract.on("Transfer", (from, to, amount, event) => {

    // The event object contains the verbatim log data, the
    // EventFragment and functions to fetch the block,
    // transaction and receipt and event functions
});

// Receive an event when that filter occurs
daiContract.on(filter, (from, to, amount, event) => {
    // The to will always be "address"
    console.log(`I got ${ formatEther(amount) } from ${ from }.`);
});

// <hide>
// Don't want to block the docs from compiling...

//

// List all transfers sent in the last 10,000 blocks
daiContract.queryFilter(filterFrom, -10000)

// List all transfers ever sent to me
daiContract.queryFilter(filterTo)


_subsection: Signing Messages @<getting-started--signing>

_code: Signing Messages @lang<javascript>

// <hide>

signature = await signer.signMessage("Hello World");
//! async signature

//
// A common case is also signing a hash, which is 32
// bytes. It is important to note, that to sign binary
// data it MUST be an Array (or TypedArray)
//

// This string is 66 characters long
message = "0xddf252ad1be2c89b69c2b068fc378daa952ba7f163c4a11628f55a4df523b3ef"
